You have two options, run standalone without source, or you can run source code with python. You can find these two downloads [here](https://github.com/deflationz/DW-Saver/releases/tag/release).

# Tutorial

To download youtube videos simply install and open DW Saver and it will prompt you to input the YouTube video link, insert it and enetr it. It will install to the directory in which you installed DW Saver itself. ***PROGRAM WILL CLOSE AFTER SUCCESS! (Temp fix below.)***

**Temp Bug Fix!**

As of v1.0 and possibly future versions DW Saver will auto close after success. You can use a terminal to fix this, if you don't know how you can learn below.

Step one of this will be launching cmd itself. Hit Windows + R and type cmd. Next you will cd into the directory of the program using cd, heres and e.g. C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\dwreleasev1.0.exe, now enter and use the program as needed.
